# Dragonite
Small definition :
DRAGONITE is a high-level programming language that will be designed using mainly JavaScript.DRAGONITE can be used to create web applications and more.
Compiler :
The compiler of DRAGONITE is a Source-To-Source compiler or a transpiler.It translates the code to JavaScript.
In DRAGONITE the code will be taken from the IDE or compiler and it will first visit the lexer(lexical ananlyzer) or tokenizer.In the lexer, the program will be checked by tokens(Integers,operators,identifiers,keywords etc.) and then the program will be send to the parser.The parser will check the syntax.If all the parameters will pass then, the compiled output will be send to the output section in the IDE.
Parser :
Parser is used to check the syntax of the program.
ALGORITHM :
Program :
write(‘Hello world!’);
OUTPUT(Process) :
Step-1:START.
Step-2:replace ‘(’ with program.
Step-3:replace ‘)’ with program.
Step-4:Split ‘write’ with program.
Step-5(FINAL): Print the output.
Output: ‘Hello world’

LEXER :
LEXER is also called tokenizer, it is the most important part of the compiler.The LEXER breaks the code into tokens.
E.X :
CODE:
Write(678);
LEXER :
1)’write’=keyword.
2)’(‘=Bracket(Special character).
3)’6’=Integer.
4)’7’=Integer.
5)’8’=Integer.
6)’)’=Bracket(Special character).
7)’;’=Semicolon(Special character).
